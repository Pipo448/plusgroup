feat: add DOP (Peso Dominiken) conversion everywhere USD displays

All amount columns now show HTG + live conversion to all enabled
currencies (USD, DOP, EUR) based on tenant.exchangeRates and
tenant.visibleCurrencies set in Settings.

- InvCard (mobile): Total / Peye / Balans each with conv line below
- InvRow (desktop): Total / Peye / Balans each with conv line below

QuotesPage.jsx
- QuoteCard (mobile): Total with conv line below
- QuoteRow (desktop): Total with conv line below

QuoteDetail.jsx
